My research journey in Master program started by working on a project that attempted to Internt of thing. The work yield an accepted paper in [The International Conference for  International Conference on Soft Computing and Data Mining (SCDM 2018)](https://link.springer.com/conference/scdm), Johor, Malaysia, February 06-07, 2018 that has been nominated for best paper. I was working mainly on the part of this work that focused on Internt of things.

Internet Of Things
======
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.A thing, in the Internet of Things, can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low -- or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and provided with the ability to transfer data over a network. IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), microservices and the internet. The convergence has helped tear down the silo walls between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), allowing unstructured machine-generated data to be analyzed for insights that will drive improvements.

Interests and additional Skills
======

Teaching:
------
As a teaching assistant for two undergraduate program courses and two master program courses, I have useful experience in this area. Teaching was exciting for me because when you teach something to someone your knowledge becomes duplicated. During my education I participated in some teaching workshops at university. I held some courses at the company I was working at back then and shared my experiences with my Colleagues.

Administration:
------
Throughout my career I have taken responsibility for a range of administrative duties. In a researcher position on a group in university, my role included collecting, analyzing and summarizing data form a variety of sources â€“ organizing and effective administrative processes were critical to the team.

IT/Technology:
------
I have extensive knowledge of Microsoft Programs and some other data analyzing tools and I am confident in the use of technology for research, administration and teaching purposes. I have working Knowledge of Programming, several kinds of software and different tools for IT. I have good learning Talent about IT and try to learn new things about it.

Language:
------
I am completely fluent in Turkish although my Native language is Persian. I participated in German language classes up to A.1.1. Level. 

Study:
------
I check the IT related news everyday on various websites; besides, I am also studying continuously about my own studying interests and brand-new innovations that are taking place throughout the world about my major and research topic from different sources. I have been also spending about 45 minutes a day reading books that are not especially related to my major for about 3 years.
